* Backlog

** Integrators

*** Subsurface scattering
- [X] Implement single scattering 
- [ ] Implement multiple scattering
  - [ ] Monte-carlo integrator
  - [ ] Next event estimation

** Materials

*** Cloth material
- [ ] Investigate dedicated cloth material with alternative BRDF (e.g. Ashikhmin)

*** Separate samplers
- [ ] Consider adding support for separate samplers per texture

** Shapes

Consider adding/improving support analytical shapes
- [-] Canopy/Half-sphere
  - [X] Intersection
  - [ ] UV sampling
- [ ] Cylinder

** Build system

Consider a cmake-based build system

** Renderer

- [-] Experiment with lock-free tile enumeration
  - [X] "Tiled scanline" with inital offset (slower)
  - [ ] Space filling curve (e.g. z-curve or hilbert-curve)

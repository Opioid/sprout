// reloading of the constants when they are referenced by more than one
// separate inline math routine called within the same function.  Declaring
// a constant locally within a routine is sufficient to prevent redundant
// reloads of that constant when that single routine is called multiple
// times in a function, but if the constant is used (and declared) in a
// separate math routine it would be reloaded.

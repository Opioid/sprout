** Brief

sprout is a small raytracing renderer written in C++. 
I work on it for fun and to learn about physically based rendering and global illumination.

The overall architecture is heavily inspired by [[http://www.pbrt.org/][PBRT]] version 2,
while the implementation details differ more or less strongly in various places.

At the moment the most advanced integrator is a uni-directional path tracer 
with forward prediction and multiple importance sampling.
Area-lights and HDRI-lights are supported.

The default material is inspired by the [[https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/library/s2012_pbs_disney_brdf_notes_v2.pdf][Disney]] and [[http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf][Unreal 4]] material models.
It uses a combination of the Disney Diffuse BRDF and GGX 
with adjustable roughness and metallic parameters.
Optionally subsurface scattering can be enabled.
Most parameters like color, roughness, and normals can be controlled via texture mapping.
Specialized materials for metal and glass are also available.

There is support for a few built in shapes (sphere, disk, plane...) as well as triangle meshes.
Those shapes are shared between solid objects, volumetric objects, and light emitters.

Support for heterogeneous participating media and subsurface scattering is based on [[http://drz.disneyresearch.com/~jnovak/publications/SDTracking/SDTracking.pdf][spectral tracking]].

A render is configurable by json files 
that describe the different parts of the scene (shapes, lights, material parameters etc.) 
as well as the camera settings.

** Build

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../source
make
#+END_EXAMPLE

[[https://travis-ci.org/Opioid/sprout][https://api.travis-ci.org/Opioid/sprout.svg?branch%3Dmaster]]

All source files needed to build the project are included in the repository and organized with cmake.

sprout needs a compiler with c++17 support.

On Linux it should work with Clang 5 and libstdc++ 7 or higher. 
It should also build with GCC 7 or higher.
On Windows it should work with Visual Studio 2017 preview or a newer version.

** Dependencies

I try to keep the number of required dependencies reasonably low in this project.
At the moment there are three.
All of them are header-only libraries and included in the repository.

1. [[https://github.com/richgel999/miniz][Miniz]] for encoding/decoding PNG images and decompressing gz archives
2. [[https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson][RapidJSON]] for parsing json files
3. [[https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts][cxxopts]] for parsing command line arguments

If you have [[https://www.ffmpeg.org/][FFmpeg]] installed you can export animations to mp4, 
but it is neither required to build nor to run.

Additionally, the repository includes a slightly modified copy of the [[http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/projects/SkylightModelling/][Hosek]] sky model.
I list this code separately from the other third-party dependencies,
because it can easily be removed without impairing the overall functionality of the renderer. 
The main changes are a conversion from ~double~ to ~float~ type 
and optimizations of pow() with a constant exponent.

** Brief

sprout is a small raytracing renderer written in C++. 
I work on it for fun and to learn about physically based rendering and global illumination.

The overall architecture is heavily inspired by [[http://www.pbrt.org/][PBRT]] 
while the implementation details differ more or less strongly in various places.

At the moment the most advanced integrator is a uni-directional path tracer 
with forward prediction and multiple importance sampling.
Area lights and HDRI lights are supported.
The default material is inspired by the [[https://disney-animation.s3.amazonaws.com/library/s2012_pbs_disney_brdf_notes_v2.pdf][Disney]] and [[http://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf][Unreal 4]] material models.
It uses a combination of the Disney Diffuse BRDF and GGX 
with adjustable roughness and metallic parameters.
Additional parameters like color and normals can be controlled via texture mapping.
Specialized materials for metal and glass are also available.
There is support for a few built in shapes (sphere, disk, plane...) as well as triangle meshes.

A render is configurable by json files 
that describe the different parts of the scene (shapes, lights, material parameters etc.) 
as well as the camera settings.

** Build

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../source "QMAKE_CXX = g++-5" "QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++14"
make
#+END_EXAMPLE

[[https://travis-ci.org/Opioid/sprout][https://api.travis-ci.org/Opioid/sprout.svg?branch%3Dmaster]]

All source files needed to build the project are included in the repository.
In order to build the project qmake is needed. 
Unfortunately there doesn't exist a cmake project yet.
Personally I use Qt Creator on both Linux and Windows.

sprout needs a compiler with c++14 support.

On Linux it should work with Clang 3.5 and libstdc++ 5 or higher. 
It should also build with GCC 5 or higher.
On Windows it should work out of the box with Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 (MSVC 14.2) 
or a newer version.

** Dependencies

I try to keep the number of required dependencies reasonably low in this project.
At the moment there are three.
All of them are header-only libraries and included in the repository.

1. [[https://github.com/richgel999/miniz][Miniz]] for encoding/decoding PNG images and decompressing gz archives
2. [[https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson][RapidJSON]] for parsing json files
3. [[https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts][cxxopts]] for parsing command line arguments

If you have [[https://www.ffmpeg.org/][FFmpeg]] installed you can export animations to mp4, 
but it is neither required to build nor to run.

Additionally, the repository includes a slightly modified copy of the [[http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/projects/SkylightModelling/][Hosek]] sky model.
I list this code separately from the other third-party dependencies,
because it can easily be removed without impairing the overall functionality of the renderer. 
The main changes are a conversion from ~double~ to ~float~ type 
and optimizations regarding pow() with a constant exponent.
